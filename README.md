# Team Profile Generator

## Description
I created this repository to hold my submission for the week 12 challenge which was to create a team profile generator, to run the team profile generator you simply run the following command: node index.js once youve opened the repository in your terminal. Once its run, it will ask a series of questions in your terminal, the answers recieved will then be displayed in a new HTML file that appears in the "output" folder

This task helped me really grasp how to work with Object oriented programming as well as libraries for me to work with. I also learnt a lot about NPM commands.

## Usage

Below is a screenshot of what the terminal should look like once the program is run and answers are given to the questions asked
